## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### **Step 1: WordPress Blog (Content Management)**
You need a WordPress blog at: `blog.iptvput.com`

**What WordPress Does:**
- ✅ Stores all your blog posts
- ✅ Manages images and media
- ✅ Provides an API (REST API) for accessing posts
- ✅ You write/edit posts in WordPress admin panel

### **Step 2: API Connection**
Your Next.js website connects to WordPress through:

**File**: `/lib/wordpress.ts`
```typescript
const WORDPRESS_API_URL = 'https://blog.iptvput.com/wp-json/wp/v2'
```

This fetches posts from WordPress and displays them on your site.

### **Step 3: Display on Website**
Your website automatically displays the posts at:
- **Blog Listing**: `iptvput.com/blog` (shows all posts)
- **Individual Posts**: `iptvput.com/blog/post-slug` (shows one post)

## 📍 **Current Status**

### ❌ **WordPress Blog NOT Set Up Yet**

**Error You're Seeing:**
```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND blog.iptvput.com
```

This means:
- ❌ `blog.iptvput.com` doesn't exist yet
- ❌ No WordPress installation
- ❌ Blog pages show "Coming Soon" message

### ✅ **What IS Working:**
- ✅ Blog page exists (`/blog`)
- ✅ Code is ready to fetch posts
- ✅ Error handling shows fallback message
- ✅ Website still works perfectly

## 🚀 **How to Set Up WordPress Blog**

### **Option 1: WordPress Hosting (Recommended)**

### **Option 2: Use WordPress.com API (No Custom Domain Needed)**

3. I can help you change the API URL

**Let me update it for you:**

Would you like me to:
